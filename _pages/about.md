I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in the **Imaging Systems Lab** and **WeLight Lab**. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Edmund Y. Lam](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~elam/) and Prof. [Evan Peng](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~evanpeng).


My academic journey has been driven by a passion for **computational imaging**, with a particular focus on **deep optics**. My research revolves around co-designing optical systems and inverse algorithms, leveraging **deep learning networks**. I also specialize in **optical numerical simulations** to model light propagations.

Before joining HKU, I completed my master’s degree at Northwestern University, where I worked in Prof. [Oliver Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/)’s Comp Photo Lab.
My work spans sparse CT reconstruction, light field holographic rendering, and deflectometry for 3D surface profiling.

Outside research, I’m a sports enthusiast — marathon, tennis, and gym keep me energized. Thriller is my favorate type of movies.
